# Pathfinder

### Current
- A* search algorithm

### WIP
- Dijkstra's
- DFS
- BFS

### Visualisation
- Programming the visualisation had led me to modify the algorithm just slightly. Normally, it runs recursively. But because I had to do testing with it, I made it such that when the function is called, the 'loop' runs only once. Because things were working and I was becoming impatient, I decided that I would simply call the function at intervals and stop when the destination node is reached.
- I had also hoped to make the start and end points a drag-and-drop. But that is proving a little too tricky (and perhaps not worth the trouble).
